# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

MODIFICATION SCOPE
Modify only the parts of the code directly related to the request.

PRESERVATION
Preserve all formatting and original names. Retain comments, annotations and documentation verbatim unless explicitly requested otherwise.

ERROR HANDLING
After making modifications, run bun run check-errors to check for TypeScript errors and fix any issues before finalizing the code output. Additional errorâ€‘checking steps are not required.

OUTPUT FORMAT
If modifications are applied, output the complete code so it can be easily copied and pasted.

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
When writing code, adhere to the following principles:

1. Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions.
2. Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity.
3. Maintain a consistent style for indentation, naming and patterns throughout the codebase.

## Project Overview

JDU Portfolio is a full-stack university student portfolio management system with Kintone integration. The system allows students to create portfolios, staff to review them, administrators to approve them, and recruiters to view approved portfolios.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.2 + Vite, Material-UI, React Router v6, i18next, Jotai
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4, PostgreSQL + Sequelize 6, JWT auth, Passport.js
- **External**: Kintone API, AWS S3/SES (optional), MinIO file storage
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 with PM2

## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
# Client (portfolio-client/)
npm run dev      # Start dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run format   # Format with Prettier

# Server (portfolio-server/)
npm run dev      # Start dev server with nodemon
npm run migrate  # Run database migrations
npm run seed     # Seed initial data
npm run refresh  # Reset DB and reseed
npm run format   # Format with Prettier

# File server (for local development)
minio server ~/minio/data
```

### Testing

No testing framework is currently configured. When implementing tests, check README or ask user for test commands.

### Deployment

```bash
# Both client and server have deploy.sh scripts
./deploy.sh  # Deploys to EC2 via SSH
```

## Architecture

### Frontend Structure

- `src/pages/` - Page components organized by feature (Profile, Draft, etc.)
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/contexts/` - React contexts (AlertContext, LanguageContext, UserContext)
- `src/locales/` - i18next translations (Japanese/English)
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

### Backend Structure

- `src/controllers/` - Express route handlers
- `src/services/` - Business logic layer
- `src/models/` - Sequelize database models
- `src/routes/` - API route definitions
- `src/middlewares/` - Authentication, error handling, etc.

### Key Models

- User (with roles: Admin, Staff, Student, Recruiter)
- Portfolio (student submissions)
- Draft (temporary saves)
- Notification (in-app notifications)
- Bookmark (recruiter bookmarks)

### API Patterns

- REST API with `/api/v1` prefix
- JWT authentication required for most endpoints
- Role-based access control via middlewares
- Swagger documentation available at `/api-docs`

## Kintone Integration

The system integrates with Kintone for managing:

- Student credits (`kintoneCreditDetailsService.js`)
- IELTS scores
- JLPT certifications
- IT contest results
- Academic achievements

Kintone services are in `src/services/kintone*.js` files.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Prettier config: tabs, no semicolons, single quotes
- Follow existing patterns in nearby files
- Use Material-UI components for UI consistency

### When Modifying Code

1. Only modify parts directly related to the request
2. Preserve all formatting, names, and comments unless specifically asked to change
3. Check for existing TODO comments before starting work
4. Run lint/format commands after changes

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure database connection
3. Set JWT_SECRET
4. Configure optional services (Google OAuth, AWS, Kintone)

### Database Operations

- Use Sequelize migrations for schema changes
- Never modify the database directly
- Test migrations locally before deploying

### File Uploads

- Supports both S3 and local MinIO storage
- Check `STORAGE_TYPE` env variable
- Files stored in `uploads/` for local storage

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Create controller method in `src/controllers/`
2. Add business logic in `src/services/`
3. Define route in `src/routes/`
4. Add appropriate middleware (auth, roles)

### Adding a New Page

1. Create page component in `src/pages/`
2. Add route in `src/routes.jsx`
3. Add translations in `src/locales/translations.js`
4. Use existing contexts and components

### Working with Kintone

1. Check `src/config/kintoneConfig.js` for app IDs
2. Use existing service patterns in `src/services/kintone*.js`
3. Handle errors appropriately (Kintone can be unavailable)

### Modifying Database Schema

1. Create migration: `npx sequelize migration:create --name your-migration-name`
2. Write up/down methods
3. Run migration: `npm run migrate`
4. Update corresponding model in `src/models/`
