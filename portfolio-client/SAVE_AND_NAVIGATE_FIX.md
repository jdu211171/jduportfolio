# Save and Navigate Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Save & Leave Not Working

**Problem**:

- Form stayed in edit mode after clicking "Save & Leave"
- Navigation didn't happen
- Page remained on profile edit

**Solution**:

- Added `setEditMode(false)` to exit edit mode
- Used `window.location.href` for clean navigation
- Added 100ms delay to ensure state updates complete

### 2. Navigation Blocking Improvements

**Problem**:

- Navigation was being blocked even after choosing an option
- Multiple intercepts causing issues

**Solution**:

- Added flags to prevent multiple intercepts
- Check edit mode state before blocking
- Improved navigation detection logic

### 3. Data Recovery After Navigation

**Problem**:

- No restore dialog when returning after "Save & Leave"

**Solution**:

- Modified the `isNavigatingAfterSave` check to show recovery dialog
- User can restore their saved work when returning to profile

## Implementation Details

### handleSaveAndNavigate Function

```javascript
const handleSaveAndNavigate = () => {
	// 1. Save data immediately
	immediateSave(editData)

	// 2. Set navigation flag
	localStorage.setItem('isNavigatingAfterSave', 'true')

	// 3. Exit edit mode (critical!)
	setEditMode(false)

	// 4. Clear warning dialog
	setShowUnsavedWarning(false)

	// 5. Navigate after delay
	setTimeout(() => {
		window.location.href = pendingNavigation.pathname
	}, 100)
}
```

### Recovery on Return

When returning to profile after "Save & Leave":

1. Checks for `isNavigatingAfterSave` flag
2. Loads saved data from localStorage
3. Shows recovery dialog
4. User can restore or discard

## User Flow

### Save & Leave Flow:

1. User in edit mode tries to navigate
2. Warning dialog appears
3. User clicks "Save & Leave"
4. Data is saved to localStorage
5. Edit mode is exited
6. Navigation happens
7. When returning, recovery dialog appears

### Discard & Leave Flow:

1. User clicks "Discard & Leave"
2. Changes are cleared
3. Edit mode is exited
4. Navigation happens immediately

## Key Changes

1. **Exit Edit Mode**: Critical for allowing navigation
2. **Use window.location**: Ensures clean navigation
3. **Recovery Dialog**: Always shows after "Save & Leave"
4. **Timing**: 100ms delay ensures all state updates complete

## Testing

1. Enter edit mode and make changes
2. Try to navigate to another page
3. Click "Save & Leave"
4. Verify:
   - Page navigates to destination
   - Edit mode is exited
   - Data is saved
5. Return to profile
6. Verify recovery dialog appears
7. Click "Restore" and verify data is recovered

The navigation now works seamlessly with proper data persistence!
