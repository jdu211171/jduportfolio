# Language Switch Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Save and Switch Not Working
- **Problem**: Data wasn't being saved before language change
- **Solution**: 
  - Added synchronous save before language change
  - Set `isLanguageSwitching` flag in localStorage
  - Clear editMode to prevent browser warning
  - Added 100ms delay to ensure localStorage write completes

### 2. Browser Warning Still Appearing
- **Problem**: Browser showed "Changes may not be saved" warning even after save
- **Solution**: 
  - Set `editMode` to false immediately after save
  - This prevents the beforeunload event from triggering

### 3. Data Not Restored After Language Switch
- **Problem**: Saved data wasn't being restored after reload
- **Solution**:
  - Check for `isLanguageSwitching` flag on page load
  - Automatically restore data without dialog
  - Show success message after restoration
  - Re-save data to maintain persistence

## Implementation Details

### Save Flow:
1. User clicks "Save & Switch"
2. `handleConfirmCancel` is called
3. Data is saved immediately with `immediateSave(editData)`
4. `isLanguageSwitching` flag is set
5. Edit mode is disabled to prevent browser warning
6. Language change proceeds after 100ms delay

### Restore Flow:
1. Page loads after language change
2. Checks for `isLanguageSwitching` flag
3. If found, loads saved data from localStorage
4. Automatically restores data and enters edit mode
5. Shows success message
6. Re-saves data to maintain persistence

### Key Changes:

1. **useFormPersistence.js**:
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Improved error handling

2. **Top.jsx**:
   - Modified `handleConfirmCancel` to properly save before language switch
   - Added `isLanguageSwitching` flag management
   - Auto-restore data after language switch without dialog
   - Clear edit mode before reload to prevent browser warning

3. **LanguageContext.jsx**:
   - Added debug logging for event flow

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Save & Switch**:
   - Enter edit mode as Student
   - Make changes
   - Change language
   - Click "Save & Switch"
   - Verify no browser warning appears
   - Verify data is restored after reload

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   Saving data before language change: {data}
   Save to localStorage complete
   Auto-restoring data after language switch: {data}
   ```

3. **Verify localStorage**:
   - Check for saved data: `profileEditDraft_profile_edit_[userId]_Student`
   - Verify `isLanguageSwitching` flag is cleared after restore

## Result
Users can now safely switch languages without losing their work. The system automatically saves and restores form data across language changes.
