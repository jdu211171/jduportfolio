# Navigation Persistence Feature Summary

## Problem Solved

When users were editing their profile and navigated to another page, all unsaved changes were lost without warning. This forced users to start over when they returned.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Navigation Blocking

- Uses React Router v6's `useBlocker` hook
- Detects when user tries to navigate away with unsaved changes
- Shows warning dialog before allowing navigation

### 2. Save Options

When navigating away with unsaved changes, users see:

- **Continue Editing** - Stay on the page
- **Discard & Leave** - Lose changes and navigate
- **Save & Leave** - Auto-save then navigate

### 3. Data Persistence

- Form data is automatically saved to localStorage during editing
- When "Save & Leave" is clicked, data is preserved
- Users can return to the page and continue where they left off

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Flow:

1. User in edit mode tries to navigate (click menu, back button, etc.)
2. `useBlocker` intercepts the navigation
3. Warning dialog appears with three options
4. Based on choice:
   - **Continue**: Cancel navigation, stay editing
   - **Discard**: Clear data, allow navigation
   - **Save**: Save to localStorage, set flag, allow navigation

### Data Recovery:

1. When returning to the profile page
2. System checks for saved data
3. If not from explicit "Save & Leave", shows recovery dialog
4. User can restore their previous work

### Key Features:

- Works with all internal navigation (menu clicks, etc.)
- Browser back/forward buttons are handled
- External navigation (closing tab) still shows browser warning
- Saved data persists for 24 hours
- Works seamlessly with language switching

## Code Changes

### Top.jsx:

```javascript
// Added navigation blocking
const blocker = useBlocker(({ currentLocation, nextLocation }) => editMode && role === 'Student' && currentLocation.pathname !== nextLocation.pathname)

// Handle blocked navigation
useEffect(() => {
	if (blocker.state === 'blocked') {
		setPendingNavigation(blocker.location)
		setShowUnsavedWarning(true)
	}
}, [blocker])

// Save & Navigate function
const handleSaveAndNavigate = () => {
	immediateSave(editData)
	localStorage.setItem('isNavigatingAfterSave', 'true')
	blocker.proceed()
}
```

### Translations Added:

- `unsavedChangesNavigationTitle`
- `unsavedChangesNavigationMessage`
- `discardAndLeave`
- `saveAndLeave`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Navigation Warning**:

   - Enter edit mode as Student
   - Make changes
   - Click on a different menu item
   - Verify warning dialog appears

2. **Test Save & Leave**:

   - In warning dialog, click "Save & Leave"
   - Verify navigation proceeds
   - Return to profile page
   - Verify data is restored

3. **Test Discard & Leave**:

   - Make changes in edit mode
   - Try to navigate away
   - Click "Discard & Leave"
   - Return to profile - data should be gone

4. **Test Continue Editing**:
   - Try to navigate with changes
   - Click "Continue Editing"
   - Verify you stay on the page in edit mode

## Benefits
