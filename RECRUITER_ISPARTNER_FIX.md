# Recruiter isPartner=true Login & Profile Access Fix

## Problem

Recruiters with `isPartner=true` were unable to access their own profile and settings pages after logging in successfully.

### Root Cause

In `portfolio-server/src/services/recruiterService.js`, the `getRecruiterById` method was filtering out all recruiters with `isPartner=true` for non-password requests (line 96):

```javascript
if (!password) where.isPartner = false
```

This meant:
1. Login worked fine (uses different authentication flow)
2. But viewing profile/settings failed because:
   - GET `/api/recruiters/:id` called `getRecruiterById(id, false)`
   - The method added `where.isPartner = false` filter
   - Recruiter with `isPartner=true` was not found
   - Returned "Recruiter not found" error

### Why This Logic Existed

The `isPartner` field is meant to be hidden from public view for privacy/business reasons. The logic was preventing public access to partner recruiters' profiles.

## Solution

Modified the code to differentiate between:
- **Public access** (viewing others' profiles) - continues to hide `isPartner=true` recruiters
- **Self access** (viewing own profile/settings) - allows access regardless of `isPartner` status

### Changes Made

#### 1. `portfolio-server/src/services/recruiterService.js`

Added `isSelf` parameter to `getRecruiterById`:

```javascript
static async getRecruiterById(recruiterId, password = false, isSelf = false) {
    // ...
    const where = { id: recruiterId }
    if (!password && !isSelf) where.isPartner = false  // Only filter if not self-access
    // ...
}
```

#### 2. `portfolio-server/src/controllers/recruiterController.js`

Updated `getById` and `update` methods to pass authentication context:

```javascript
static async getById(req, res, next) {
    const authenticatedUserId = req.user?.id
    const authenticatedUserType = req.user?.userType
    const isSelf = authenticatedUserType === 'Recruiter' && 
                   String(authenticatedUserId) === String(req.params.id)
    const recruiter = await RecruiterService.getRecruiterById(req.params.id, false, isSelf)
    // ...
}

static async update(req, res, next) {
    // Similar logic for password updates
    const isSelf = authenticatedUserType === 'Recruiter' && 
                   String(authenticatedUserId) === String(id)
    const recruiter = await RecruiterService.getRecruiterById(id, true, isSelf)
    // ...
}
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Login as a recruiter with `isPartner=true`
2. Navigate to profile page (`/profile/company/:id`)
3. Navigate to settings page (`/settings`)
4. Both should now load successfully

## Security Notes

- The fix maintains privacy: `isPartner=true` recruiters are still hidden from public GET requests
- Only authenticated recruiters can access their own data regardless of `isPartner` status
- The `authMiddleware` on `/api/recruiters` routes ensures proper authentication
- No changes needed to client-side code
