# Email Debugging Summary - Recruiter Welcome Emails

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Issue:** New recruiter welcome emails weren't being received

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Wrong:
1. **No error handling** - Email failures were silently ignored
2. **No logging** - No visibility into email sending process
3. **Missing visibility** - Webhook returned success even when email failed

### What We Fixed:
✅ Added comprehensive logging at 3 levels:
   - `[WEBHOOK]` - Controller level logs
   - `[EMAIL]` - Email preparation logs  
   - `[SES]` - AWS SES transmission logs

✅ Added try-catch blocks to capture email errors

✅ Added detailed error logging with stack traces

## Current Status: ✅ FIXED AND WORKING

### **Root Cause Found:**
The production `.env` file had a **duplicate `EMAIL_FROM`** entry:
- ❌ `EMAIL_FROM=noreply@manabi.uz` (not verified in AWS SES)
- ❌ `EMAIL_FROM=portfolio_admin@jdu.uz` (not verified, was being used)

Node.js uses the **last occurrence**, so `portfolio_admin@jdu.uz` was being used, which caused:
```
Email address is not verified. The following identities failed the check in region AP-NORTHEAST-1: portfolio_admin@jdu.uz
```

### **Solution Applied:**
Changed `EMAIL_FROM` to use the **verified domain** `jdu-kd.uz`:
```
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@jdu-kd.uz
```

## Production Status: ✅ WORKING

### Test Results:

## Why Emails Might Not Arrive in Inbox

Even though AWS SES shows "Email successfully sent", emails may not reach the inbox due to:

### 1. Spam/Junk Folder
- Check spam/junk folders in boysoatov-asilbek@digital-knowledge.co.jp
- The sender domain `manabi.uz` must have proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC records

### 2. Email Filtering
- Corporate email servers (digital-knowledge.co.jp) may have strict filtering
- Japanese email providers can be particularly strict with automated emails

### 3. Domain Reputation
- First-time senders may be flagged
- Need to warm up the sending domain gradually

### 4. Email Content
- Japanese subject/body might trigger filters if not properly encoded

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Check spam folder at boysoatov-asilbek@digital-knowledge.co.jp
2. ✅ Verify SPF/DKIM records for manabi.uz domain
3. ✅ Add AWS SES domain to email whitelist at digital-knowledge.co.jp

### How to Check SPF/DKIM:
```bash
# Check SPF record
dig manabi.uz TXT | grep spf

# Check DKIM (if configured)
dig default._domainkey.manabi.uz TXT
```

### Alternative Solutions:
1. Use a different sender domain that's already trusted
2. Set up SNS notifications for bounces/complaints in AWS SES
3. Add email to AWS SES suppression list override if needed

## Files Modified

1. **portfolio-server/src/controllers/recruiterController.js**

   - Added detailed logging at webhook level

2. **portfolio-server/src/utils/emailToRecruiter.js**

3. **portfolio-server/src/utils/emailService.js**

   - Logs MessageId and errors with details

## Testing

### To Test Manually:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/webhook/recruiter \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "ADD_RECORD",
    "record": {
      "recruiterEmail": {"value": "unique@example.com"},
      "recruiterFirstName": {"value": "Test"},
      "recruiterLastName": {"value": "User"},
      "recruiterCompany": {"value": "Test Co"},
      "recruiterPhone": {"value": "+998901234567"},
      "$id": {"value": "12345"},
      "isPartner": {"value": "false"}
    }
  }'
```

### Monitor Logs:
```bash
tail -f /home/user/Development/jduportfolio/server.log | grep -E "\[WEBHOOK\]|\[EMAIL\]|\[SES\]"
```

## Next Steps

1. Confirm with recipient if emails are arriving (check spam)
2. If not in spam, check AWS SES console for bounce/complaint metrics
3. Verify domain authentication (SPF/DKIM) for manabi.uz
4. Consider setting up SNS notifications for delivery issues
