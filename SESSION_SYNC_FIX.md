# Session Storage Sync Fix

## Problem

When users logged in and navigated to their profile in one tab, then opened a new tab and navigated directly to `/profile/top`, they encountered the error:

```
Error: No valid student ID found
Debug info: id=, role=, studentId=, userId=
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. **Authentication uses HTTP-only cookies** - These cookies ARE shared between tabs ✅
2. **User data is stored in sessionStorage** - This is NOT shared between tabs ❌
3. **New tab has empty sessionStorage** - When opening a new tab and navigating directly to a profile URL:
   - The `ProtectedRoute` component checks cookies (present) → Access granted ✅
   - The `StudentProfile` component reads from `sessionStorage` (empty) → No student ID found ❌

## Solution

Updated `UserContext.jsx` to automatically sync `sessionStorage` from cookies when it's empty:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `UserContext.jsx`

- Added `isInitializing` state to track authentication initialization
- Modified `fetchAndSetUser()` to check if `sessionStorage` is empty but cookies exist
- If cookies exist but `sessionStorage` is empty:
  - Calls `/api/auth/me` endpoint to fetch user data
  - Populates `sessionStorage` with data from cookies and API response
  - Sets user state in context
- Returns `isInitializing` in context value to allow components to wait for sync

#### 2. Updated `StudentProfile.jsx`

- Now uses `UserContext` to access user data and `isInitializing` flag
- Uses `activeUser` from context as the primary source of truth
- Waits for initialization to complete before attempting to fetch student data
- Properly handles the case where context provides the student ID

## How It Works

### First Tab (Login Flow)

1. User logs in → Server sets cookies
2. Client stores data in `sessionStorage`
3. Navigation works normally

### Second Tab (Direct URL)

1. User opens new tab and navigates to `/profile/top`
2. `ProtectedRoute` checks cookies → Access granted
3. `UserContext` initializes:
   - Detects empty `sessionStorage` but valid cookies
   - Calls `/api/auth/me` to fetch user data
   - Populates `sessionStorage` with user data
4. `StudentProfile` waits for initialization
5. Once initialized, student ID is available
6. Profile loads successfully

## Files Modified

- `portfolio-client/src/contexts/UserContext.jsx`
- `portfolio-client/src/pages/Profile/StudentProfile/StudentProfile.jsx`

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Login to the application in one tab
2. Open a new tab
3. Navigate directly to `http://localhost:5173/profile/top`
4. Profile should load without errors

## Technical Details

- Uses the existing `/api/auth/me` endpoint (already protected with `authMiddleware`)
- Only syncs when `sessionStorage` is empty AND cookies are present
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing login flow
- No changes required to backend code
